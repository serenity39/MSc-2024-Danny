what is the role of t tubules	This is where the T-tubules come in. They transmit electrical impulses from one muscle cell to another. This way, only some muscle cells need to be activated by a nerve--the rest will be signaled through the T-tubule network, so that all of the muscle cells will contract together.
what is the role of t tubules	The importance of T-tubules is not solely due to their concentration of L-type calcium channels, but lies also within their ability to synchronise calcium release within the cell. The rapid spread of the action potential along the T-tubule network activates all of the L-type calcium channels near-simultaneously.

what is the role of t tubules	In between two terminal cisternae is a tubular infolding called a transverse tubule (T tubule). T tubules are the pathways for action potentials to signal the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium, causing a muscle contraction. Together, two terminal cisternae and a transverse tubule form a triad.

Collision of plates (especially two continental plates) is the chief cause of mountain-building.
which kind of continental boundary is formed where two plates move horizontally past one another?	Lesson Summary. The African tectonic plate (which is a rigid piece of the earth’s crust and are bounded by major fault lines on all sides) is one of the eight major tectonic plates making up the earth’s crust. Tectonic plates are rigid pieces of crust that move on top of the semi-molten mantle. They are bounded by either convergent (where two plates are colliding), divergent (where two plates are moving apart from each other), or transform boundaries (where two plates are moving laterally past each other).The African plate is bounded by divergent boundaries, where the plates are moving apart, and convergent boundaries, where the plates are colliding.
which kind of continental boundary is formed where two plates move horizontally past one another?	Active continental margin: A continental margin that has a very narrow, or even nonexistent,  continental shelf and a narrow and steep continental slope that ends  in a deep trench instead of a continental rise; it is marked by  earthquake and volcanic activity.
which kind of continental boundary is formed where two plates move horizontally past one another?	Convergent boundaries happen where two plates collide together, as seen in the Washington-Oregon coastline of the United States, where the Pacific Plate gets forced beneath the North American plate, creating a subduction zone that destroys oceanic crust. Transform boundaries, also known as conservative boundaries, ensue where two plates slide horizontally past each other.

The way one plate moves relative to another determines the type of boundary: spreading, where the two plates move away from each other; subduction, where the two plates move toward each other, with one sliding beneath the other; and transform, where the two plates slide horizontally past each other.
which kind of continental boundary is formed where two plates move horizontally past one another?	In a diverging boundary, two plates move apart. This occurs on the sea floor and is known as sea floor spreading. Magma will rise up and fill in the gap as the two plates separate. This forms a mid-ocean ridge. Another boundary is called a transform boundary where two plates slide past one another.
which kind of continental boundary is formed where two plates move horizontally past one another?	Subduction. Oceanic-Continental Subduction. Oceanic-Oceanic Subduction. Collisions. References. Convergent boundaries, also called destructive boundaries, are places where two or more plates move toward each other.
