which part of the life cycle is dominant in bryophyte?	What You Need To Know About Bryophytes. Bryophytes are embryophytes that are non-vascular in other words; they have no xylem and phloem. Prominent phase in the life of bryophytes is haploid gametophyte. Gametophyte and Sporophyte in bryophytes are physically connected unlike in the pteridophytes.
which part of the life cycle is dominant in bryophyte?	All plants have gametophytes and sporophytes, but there is a considerable difference between the major plant groups as to which is the dominant stage. In the bryophytes the gametophyte is dominant. Gametophytes are persistent and, from time to time, gives rise to sporophytes.

Moreover, the gametophyte of bryophytes and algae is the dominant phase of the life cycle while in other plants, the dominant phase of the life cycle is the sporophyte. Also, some bryophytes including liverworts develop male and female gametophytes separately by the germination of microspores and megaspores respectively.
which part of the life cycle is dominant in bryophyte?	The gametophytes are very small and cannot exist independent of the parent plant. The reproductive structures of the sporophyte (cones in gymnosperms and flowers in angiosperms), produce two different kinds of haploid spores: microspores (male) and megaspores (female).
which part of the life cycle is dominant in bryophyte?	The ability of the plants to reproduce sexually and asexually helps them to adapt to different environments. The alternation of generations depends upon the type of the plant. In Bryophytes, the dominant generation is haploid and the gametophyte comprises the main plant. In tracheophytes, the dominant generation is diploid and the sporophyte comprises the main plant.

which kind of continental boundary is formed where two plates move horizontally past one another?	Transform fault boundaries. The zone between two plates sliding horizontally past one another is 
	called a transform-fault boundary, or simply a transform boundary. These 
	boundaries, like the San Andreas fault in California, are marked by strong 
	earthquakes. Most transform faults are found on the ocean floor.
which kind of continental boundary is formed where two plates move horizontally past one another?	Transform Boundaries. . Transform boundaries are when two tectonic plates slide horizontally past one another. Like divergent boundaries, transform boundaries can occur underwater or on land. When the two plates slide past each other, friction is caused, building up stress in both plates, which then causes an earthquake.
which kind of continental boundary is formed where two plates move horizontally past one another?	Plates can (blank) Pull apart, collide, and move past each other. The boundary between two plates that are moving apart is a (blank) Divergent boundary. When ocean plates collide with continental plates,the denser ocean plate (blank) Sinks. The area where a plate decends is a (blank) Subduction zone.
